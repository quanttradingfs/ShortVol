## Project Outline (Work-in-progress)
- (1) Data retrieval
    - Ideally via API (OpenBB, YFinance, IBKR...)
- (2) Calculate Historical Volatility
    - Historical vs Prediction
- (3) Calculate Implied Volatility
    - Via Options (Need data like dividends, strike, expiry etc)
    - Black-Scholes/Binomial tree option pricing

- (4) Generate Signals from Strategies
    - Mean reversion?
    - ML?
- (5) Structure trades with short straddles/strangles
- (5) Backtesting
- (6) Implementation in Alpaca
